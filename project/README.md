#### Description:In the final project，I made a simple C compiler with C language that is bootstrapped and it can process some basic functions.Compiler is a tool that converts a high-level language into a mechanical language.In the process, it will go through six processes：Lexical Analysis，Syntactic Analysis，Semantic Analysis，Intermediate Code Generation，Code Optimization and Code Generation.The first thing to note is that, despite the title, we are actually building an interpreter for the C language, which means that we can run the C source files as if they were scripts. The reason for doing this is twofold:An interpreter differs from a compiler only in the code generation phase, while other aspects such as lexical analysis and syntax analysis are the same.The interpreter requires us to implement our own virtual machine and instruction set, and this part helps us understand how computers work.Once I saw a project on Github which was hot at the time called c4, which claimed to implement a small C compiler with only 4 functions.What shocked me most about it was that it's a bootstrapped compiler which means it can compile itself.And it did it with very little code to make a fairly functional C compiler.The things we need to do include building our own virtual machine as well as instruction sets, lexical parser, and syntax parser.On why do a compiler it, I want to say that understanding the principle of compilation of ideas more to understand the current main compiler will have a powerful role, so that you can be based on the compiler's implementation of the mechanism to do the language, such as C + + above the optimization, such as some of the keywords, smart pointers, and so on, essentially uploading the compiler level is to do how to deal with it, and only to understand enough in order to be more optimized.In order to write the program to be "useful", in addition to the core logic also need input and output, such as C we often use the printf function is used for output. However, the implementation of the printf function itself is very complex, if our compiler to achieve bootstrap, it is inevitable that the implementation of printf and other functions, but it does not have much to do with the compiler, so we continue to implement the new instructions, from the point of view of the virtual machine to be supported. The functions we need to use in the compiler are: exit, open, close, read, printf, malloc, memset and memcmp.Regarding why we need to design a virtual machine, in real computers, adding a new instruction requires the design of many new circuits, which adds a lot of cost, but in our virtual machine, the new instruction consumes almost no resources, so we can take advantage of this by using more instructions to accomplish more functions, thus simplifying the specific implementation.
